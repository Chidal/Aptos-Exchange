# Zetaz-uniswap 

## What it does

Zeta-Uniswap offers a seamless platform for users to swap their digital assets built on the ZetaChain. It provides a user-friendly interface and robust backend infrastructure to ensure smooth and efficient asset exchanges. The app supports various types of digital assets, including cryptocurrencies and tokens, enabling users to diversify their portfolios easily.

Secure wallet integration to protect user assets.

Advanced encryption techniques to ensure data privacy.

Multi-factor authentication for an added layer of security.

## The problem it solves

Centralization: Traditional exchanges are centralized, posing security risks and potential downtime.  offers a decentralized solution, ensuring greater security and availability.

High Fees: Centralized exchanges often have high transaction fees. Our platform minimizes fees by utilizing the efficient Zetachain.

User Control: Users will retain full control over their funds, as transactions are executed directly from their wallets without intermediaries.

Speed: By the Zetachain, transactions are going to be processed quickly, enhancing the user experience.



## Challenges I ran into

Learning Curve: Adapting to the Zetachain's unique features was initially challenging.

Integration: Ensuring seamless wallet integration and smooth user experience required meticulous testing and debugging.

Performance Optimization: Optimizing the app to handle multiple transactions efficiently while maintaining responsiveness.

Security: Implementing robust security measures to protect user data and funds from potential threats.





## Technologies I used
Frontend:

React Styled-components, Apollo Client GraphQL

Blockchain:

Solidity for smart contracts, Hardhat for development and testing, Ethers.js for blockchain interactions

Zetachain's technologies

## How we built it

Frontend Development:

Using React and styled-components, I created a user-friendly interface for the exchange.

Smart Contract Development:

Writing the smart contracts in solidity

Used Hardhat for testing and deployment.

Blockchain Integration:

Still under development.

Continuous Improvement: Iteratively improved the application based on feedback and performance metrics.



## What we learned

Blockchain Integration: Still developing and deploying in the Aptos chain.

Decentralized Application Development: Improved my ability to develop and maintain decentralized applications (dApps).



## What's next for

Proper utilization zetachain's technologies and making proper use of it's resources, going into the chain and testing the availability to comply and adapt with the other chains.
